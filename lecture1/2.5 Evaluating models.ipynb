    "- Typically, machine learning involves a lot of experimentation. Running a learning algorithm over a training dataset with different hyperparameter settings and different features will result in different models. Since we are typically interested in selecting the best-performing model from this set, we need to find a way to estimate their respective performances in order to rank them against each other.\n",

Although many concepts also apply to regression analysis, we will focus on **classification**, the assignment of categorical target labels to the samples."

    "Depending on your application, you may want to consider different performance metrics. Choice of metric depends on your business objective and on the data you have at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases **accuracy** alone will be enough. It is suitable when the data is balanced (equal number of observations in each class) and when minimizing *False Positives* and *False Negatives* is equally important.\n",

    "\n",

    "##### Case 1: Spam filter (positive class is \"spam\")\n",
    "FN (spam goes to the inbox) are more acceptable than FP (non-spam is caught by the spam filter) => Choose **FP** as a variable, optimize for **precision**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 2: Fraudulent transaction detector (positive class is \"fraud\")\n",
